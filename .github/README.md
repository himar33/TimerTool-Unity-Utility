# ABOUT
TimerTool is a versatile and easy-to-use timer utility for Unity, designed to streamline time-based operations and events in your projects. This tool allows developers to create, manage, and control timers with various functionalities, including real-time and game-time support, pausing, looping, and event-triggering at specific intervals.
## Why TimerTool?
Managing timers in Unity can be challenging, with various approaches leading to verbose or error-prone code. TimerTool resolves these concerns by offering a user-friendly interface that brings expressive and easy-to-read timers to both MonoBehaviour and non-MonoBehaviour classes. Say goodbye to cumbersome coroutine implementations or complex time checks in Update methodsâ€”TimerTool takes care of it all, so you can focus on bringing your creative visions to life.
## Accreditation
The TimerTool repository is inspired by the excellent work of [Alexander Biggs](http://akbiggs.xyz/) and [Adam Robinson-Yu](https://adamgryu.com/), who developed the original Unity Timer library. Their dedication to creating a robust and reliable time management solution for Unity has paved the way for the TimerTool project.

We would like to extend our gratitude to Alexander Biggs and Adam Robinson-Yu for their valuable contributions to the Unity community. Their innovative approach to timer management has inspired and influenced the development of TimerTool, allowing us to build upon their foundation to provide an enhanced timer utility for Unity developers.
